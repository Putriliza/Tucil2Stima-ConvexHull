# CONVEX HULL FOR LINEAR SEPARABILITY TEST VISUALIZATION USING DIVIDE AND CONQUER ALGORITHM

### GENERAL INFORMATION
Divide and conquer algorithm is used to find the convex hull of a set of points on a 2D cartesian plane. This algorithm divide the set of points into several parts based on certain conditions and then do it recursively until all points of the convex hull are found. This program can test the linear separability of 4 dataset from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html) (Iris, Wine, Breast_cancer, and Digits).

### REQUIREMENT
- [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [matplotlib 3.5.1](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
- [numpy 1.22.2](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [pandas 1.4.1](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
- [scikit-learn 1.0.2](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

### HOW TO RUN
- First, clone this repository
    ```
    https://github.com/Putriliza/Tucil2Stima-ConvexHull.git
    ```
- Open in terminal
- Change directory to src
    ```
    cd src
    ```
- Then run
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
